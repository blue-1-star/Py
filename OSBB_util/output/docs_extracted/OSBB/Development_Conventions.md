## Python internal import order

Date: 2026-07-06

For OSBB Python entrypoints, internal project imports must be placed only after
the project root has been added to `sys.path`.

Correct order:

1. Python standard library imports.
2. External library imports.
3. Determine `BOT_DIR`, `OSBB_ROOT`, `PY_ROOT` or equivalent project roots.
4. Insert project roots into `sys.path`.
5. Import internal OSBB modules, for example `config`, `handlers`, `tools`.

Reason: some entrypoints are launched from subdirectories, for example `OSBB\Bots`.
In that case `tools`, `config`, and other OSBB-level packages are not importable
until `OSBB_ROOT` is added to `sys.path`.

Patchers must preserve this rule and must not insert `tools.*` imports at the
top of `parking_bot.py` before the `sys.path` setup block.
