On August 31, 2023, the Debtors filed amendments to the June Schedules [D.I. 2285-2408] (collectively, the “August Schedules”).

With respect to Schedules E/F – which identify creditors of the Debtors with non-priority unsecured claims (including customers with a net positive account balance as of November 11, 2022) – in an effort to redact customer names and addresses, the Debtors have identified each customer with a net positive account balance as of November 11, 2022 by a unique customer code (a “Unique Customer Code”).

EASTERN TIME. PLEASE SEE THE NOTICE LINKED ABOVE FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS.   

PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT THE DEBTORS RESERVE ALL RIGHTS TO OBJECT TO ANY PROOFS OF CLAIM, INCLUDING ANY NEW PROOFS OF CLAIM FILED ON ACCOUNT OF LIABILITIES OTHER THAN THE AMENDED LIABILITY.   

PLEASE BE FURTHER ADVISED THAT RECEIPT OF THIS EMAIL AND A UNIQUE CUSTOMER CODE ONLY INDICATES THAT YOU HAD ONE OR MORE CLAIM(S) LISTED ON ONE OR MORE OF THE DEBTORS’ SCHEDULES AND STATEMENTS.
